## How to Contribute

### Submitting a Resource

Resources are stored in `src/data/resources.json`. To add a new resource:

1. Open `src/data/resources.json`
2. Add a new entry to the `resources` array:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-resource-id",
  "title": "Resource Name",
  "description": "A clear, concise description of what this resource does.",
  "category": "agent|prompt|instruction|plugin|workflow",
  "author": "your-github-username",
  "authorUrl": "https://github.com/yourusername",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
  "url": "https://link-to-resource",
  "addedAt": "2026-04-03",
  "stars": 0
}
```

3. **Validate your data**: Run the validation script to ensure your JSON is correct:
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```
4. **Test your changes locally**: `npm run dev`
5. **Commit and push your changes**
6. **Open a Pull Request**

#### Resource Guidelines

- **Unique ID**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `code-review-agent`)
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive, and concise
- **Description**: 1-2 sentences explaining what the resource does
- **Category**: Must be one of the allowed values
- **Tags**: Add 3-5 relevant tags for discoverability
- **URL**: Link to the actual resource (GitHub repo, demo, docs)
